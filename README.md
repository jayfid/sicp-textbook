# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
## An improved experience
_(MIT Press, 1984; ISBN 0-262-01077-1)_

One of the most beloved books in CS is currently [available free](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) on MIT's website, or for purchase in hard and soft cover.

However, these copies don't work well for those of us who read on our phones or eReaders.

MIT's hosted code is largely outdated autogenerated html. This update allows one of computer programming's most iconic texts to be made accessible on web, mobile, and ereader devices.
