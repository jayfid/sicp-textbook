## TODO
- define best styling rules
- finish build process
- add exports for kindles

## Gulp Tasks
- `striptags`: Read in source files and remove incorrect HTML
- `styles`: Copy styles into build folder
- `htmllint`: Validate html in generated files
- `images`: Optimze source images and output into build directory
- `clean`: Remove generated files and folders
- `browser-sync`: Preview HTML files in browser
- `bundle`: Build generated files into epub(?) format
